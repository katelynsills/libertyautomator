libertyautomator
================

A script I made to automate the job search process. It creates a csv database of jobs from libertyguide.com and emails you when new jobs appear. To use, simply put your gmail email address and password in the top of the file as indicated, and run the file ("ruby libertyautomator" in the folder it's stored in, in the terminal.)  Be careful when editing the file, as you're dealing with server requests and sending emails. Hope this helps!
